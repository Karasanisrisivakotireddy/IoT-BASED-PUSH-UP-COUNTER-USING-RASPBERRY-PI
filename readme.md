This project is an AI-based push-up counter built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe Pose Estimation.It uses a webcam to detect human body landmarks in real time and track elbow movement during push-ups.The elbow joint angle is calculated to accurately identify correct push-up posture and movement.Each complete push-up is automatically counted without manual input.The system provides real-time visual feedback by displaying the angle and count on the screen.Text-to-speech functionality announces each push-up to motivate the user during workouts.Push-up count data is uploaded to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for remote monitoring.This enables basic IoT integration with fitness analytics.At the end of the workout session, an email summary is sent to the user.This helps users keep a record of their fitness activity.The project demonstrates practical use of computer vision in health and fitness applications.It also showcases real-time pose estimation and motion tracking techniques.The application is lightweight and can run on a standard webcam setup.This project is suitable for beginners exploring AI-based fitness systems.Overall, it highlights the integration of AI, IoT, and real-time user interaction in a single solution.
